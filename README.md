## **Project Motivation**

The COVID19 turned into a global pandemic and hit lots of countries on the planet. I was interested the situation in the US in 2020 based on a dataset from CDC.
Particularly I wanted to explore the following topics:

1. What is the time-series trend of confirmed cases and death in the US?
2. What social events might contribute to the change of the trend?
3. Where will the trend move toward in 2021?
4. What are the regional differences and how the neighbor states situation affect mine? 

By answering the questions above, I should have a good understanding of how the Covid developed in the US and some factors that might contribute to the trend.
At the end, I am also curious about seeing how the situation will turn in 2021. 

## **File Description**
There are 3 notebooks available to showcase work related to the above questions. Each notebook has its title related to the questions above. And each notebook starts with data gathering, visualization, modeling and evaluation. Some markdown cells also assists to understand the working process.

There is an additional helper.py file that contains some useful functions in preparing data and plots.
